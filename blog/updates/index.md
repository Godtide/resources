---

Contributions to [Truffle University Resources](https://resources.truffle.university/) are very much welcome. For reference it uses the [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) documentation generator packaged as a [Gatsby Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/), and running on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). That said, you don't need to worry about any of this detail to contribute...

## Contribution Steps

- Create a new branch from `master`
- If you originally published your blog with medium you can use [medium-2-md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medium-2-md) to convert it to markdown 
- Open the relevant file in the `docs` or `blog` directory and edit the [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) (which is just [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with JSX only interleaved if you want to add in-page [interactivity](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html))
- Commit and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/truffleuniversity/resources/pulls)

Suggestions on changing or improving any of the above are very welcome too.
