# Glossary

## Development

- **ABI** (Application Binary Interface) A JSON description of the external interface for a Contract Instance, or for the description of common interface of all instances of a Contract Type.
- **EIP** (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) A document proposed to the Ethereum community, describing a proposed new standard for the Ethereum platform.
- **EOA** (Externally Owned Account) An account that is controlled by a private key (as opposed to smart contract code).
- **Gas** An independent unit of account for pricing smart contract computations and transactions on the Ethereum network.
- **Remix** A [browser-based IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) for Solidity and Vyper with integrated debugging, testing, and a virtual blockchain for convenient smart contract development.

## Ethereum

- **Address** 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string representing an account’s public identifier
- **ENS** (Ethereum Name Service) A smart contract based registration and resolution system for mapping Ethereum addresses to human-readable names.
- **EVM** (Ethereum Virtual Machine) The runtime environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Layer 2 (L2)** Scaling mechanisms that are not part of the core protocol, but utilize the root chain for security.
- **Solidity** The most fully supported programming language (of a handful of options) that can be readily compiled into bytecode for the EVM.
- **UTXO** (Unspent Transaction Output) The outputs of a blockchain transaction that are available as inputs for another transaction.

## Security

- **Mythril** Security analysis tool for EVM bytecode. Supports smart contracts built for Ethereum, Quorum, Vechain, Roostock, Tron and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
- **SmartCheck** Automatically checks Smart Contracts for vulnerabilities and bad practices – it highlights them in the code and gives a detailed explanation of the problem.

## Cryptography

- **Keccak256** Cryptographic hash function used widely at a contract-level as well as internally (e.g. hashes for block headers). Slightly different algorithm from SHA-3 standard.
